# CoreOS uses etcd, a service running on each machine, to handle coordination between software running on the cluster.
# For a group of CoreOS machines to form a cluster, their etcd instances need to be connected.
# A discovery service, https://discovery.etcd.io, 
# is provided as a free service to help connect etcd instances together by storing a list of peer addresses, 
# metadata and the initial size of the cluster under a unique address, known as the discovery URL. 
# You can generate them very easily:

# curl -w "\n" 'https://discovery.etcd.io/new?size=3'
# https://discovery.etcd.io/6a28e078895c5ec737174db2419bb2f3	 
# $ DISCOVERY_TOKEN=`curl -s https://discovery.etcd.io/new`
# $ sed -i "s@discovery: https://discovery.etcd.io/<token>@discovery: $DISCOVERY_TOKEN@g" cloud-config.yaml
# $ coreos-install -d /dev/sda -C stable -c ~/cloud-config.yaml

# On Debian/Ubuntu (via the package "whois")
# mkpasswd --method=SHA-512 --rounds=4096

# OpenSSL (note: this will only make md5crypt.  While better than plantext it should not be considered fully secure)
# openssl passwd -1

# Python (change password and salt values)
# python -c "import crypt, getpass, pwd; print crypt.crypt('password', '\$6\$SALT\$')"

# Perl (change password and salt values)
# perl -e 'print crypt("password","\$6\$SALT\$") . "\n"'
